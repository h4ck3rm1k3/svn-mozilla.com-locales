;Your apps on all your devices
War porogaramey war jinawey kul ga


;MobBase builds apps for bands and labels.
MobBase ga porogaramyaŋ cin donkey še.


;We make it very easy for bands to connect with their fans all across mobile devices.
Ir ga hansa ka faalandi donkey še i ma duu ngey hangakey alhabar kanbe-jinay kul ga.


;We recognize that there is a big problem that artists had.
Ir ga bay kaŋ hooraykey doona ka dii šenday beeri.


;They have all these fans who are using all sorts of devices
Ir goo nda hangakey wey kul kaŋ goo nda jinay dumi kul


;and their websites are not going to work well on various devices.
nda ngey Interneti nungey ši fatta boryo jinay dumey wey ga.


;So we started off working in native environments, iPhone first, then Android,
Woo še ir šintin ha goy lasal windilawey ra, iPhone jina, bandaa ga Android


;and each has its own complexities and subtleties that make it difficult to maintain and iterate on both.
nd'affoo kul goo nda nga šiiriyaney nda boŋ-alhaaley kaŋ ga taagandiyan nda fillayan šendandi i kul ga.


;We quickly realized that the key to getting a cross-platform solution for most artists was HTML5
Ir tanba ka bay kaŋ HTML5 ti fonda kaŋ ga maršin-boobo goyyan faalandi donkaw boobaa še


;and the reason is this:
nda daliloo ti woo:


;To build a native iPhone App, a native Android App and a native whatever App, is time consuming
Ka lasal porogaram tee iPhone, Android nda lasal porogaram dumi tana kul še, woo ga waati ŋaa 


;and each app is a different project and each app requires different assets
nda porogaram foo kul ti porože kaŋ ga waani nda affoo kul ga baa goyjinay tana


;and it becomes a real headache in terms of time and also money.
nda a ga boŋsari beeri foo waatoo nda nooroo kaŋ woo ga baa.


;What HTML5 allows our clients to do is to build the app once and distribute it everywhere.
HTML5 g'ir daykey gaa ka porogaramoo cin cee foo nd'a žemni nungu kul ra. 


;With the  Mozilla Marketplace we have a unique opportunity to distribute web applications.
Nda Mozilla Marketplace ir goo nda fondo cerecerante ka Interneti porogaramey žemni.


;This is something that was king of a conundrum for us, you know
Woo tin boŋhawey kul baalijoo ir hunday še, war ga bay wala


;we want to be able to distribute these and not just provide links.
z'ir ga baa ir ma hin ka wey žemni, manti ka dobuyaŋ de cebe.


;When Mozilla reached out to us and we entered a partnership with them
Waati kaŋ Mozilla n'ir gar nda iri nd'ay na allaahidu dam cere še


;it was great because it was an App store.
a boori zama porogaram neeredoo no.


;Fans can go to it, they can see the assets, they can see the description
Hangakey ga hin ka koy noodin, ka goyjinawey zaa, ka dii šilbayyanoo


;they can download it just like they’re used to downloading an Android or iPhone app.
i ga hin k'a zumandi sanda taka kaŋ nd'i doona Android nda iPhone porogaram še.


;So, Mozilla provides a great, great market and a great distribution channels for our HTML5 Apps.
Adiši Mozilla ka hebu beeri, beeri foo feeri nda žemnari fonda beeriyaŋ ir HTML5 porogaramey še.
