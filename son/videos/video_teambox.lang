;Teambox is an online collaboration software that can be hosted in the cloud or onsite
Teambox ti Interneti porogaram goykašinay kaŋ ga hin ga zunbu duula wala nungu ga


;that allows teams of any size to collaborate more efficiently,
ka too konday dumi kul ma hin ka goy nda cere ka sahã,


;communicate with each other, share files and manage tasks.
ka šelaŋ nda cere, ka tukey žemni nda goymiɲey juwal.


;We’re fortunate enough to have customers all over the world
Ir tee saaye da kaŋ ir goo nda daykawyaŋ adduɲɲaa kul ra


;and using HTML5 we know that we can deliver a consistent user experience
nda HTML5 goyoo ra ir ga bay kaŋ ir ga hin kookari ka goykaw binekaani


;to those customers anywhere they are, no matter what device they are using.
daykey kul še noodin kaŋ i goo, a ši nda taali maršin kul kaŋ goo i še.


;There is actually one customer that’s coming to mind called iBolt
Nda cimi woo daykaw foo kaŋ še i ga nee iBolt ga kaa lakkal ra


;and they manufacture wireless accessories all over the world.

;but we know that all of them have a consistent and great user experience using HTML5
amma ir ga bay kaŋ wey kul ga duumi ka goyyan kaani noo nda HTML5


;and that gives us a lot of assurance as a software developer.
nda woo g'ir biney kanandi, ir kaŋ ti porogaram cinkaw


;Obviously we could build native applications, but doing so,
Alhakiika ra ir ga hin ka ir boŋ porogaramyaŋ cin amma woo


;for a small fast-growing company like us,
ir kaŋ ti konday kayna kaŋ ga cahã ka beeri,


;takes a lot of time, a lot of extra money and

;it impacts our ability to deliver a great app to market sooner.
a g'ir ganji ka cahã ka porogaran suubante dam heboo ra.


;So we made the decision not to build native apps
Woo še ir yadda kaŋ ir ši porogaram tee ir boŋ še


;and we’re using technologies like HTML5 to get to market faster
nd'ir ga goy nda dabaribayrawey sanda HTML5 ka heboo dam tanba


;with better products and ultimately to deliver a better user experience for our customers.

;Quite frankly we see it as a terrific onramp for our business

;Already today we see almost 1,000 signups a day without the Mozilla Marketplace

;So we see it as a tremendous opportunity.

;Something that gives us more visibility, more cachet in the market
Haya foo no kaŋ g'ir tunandi moo ra, a g'ir kaataray heboo ra


;and we’re really excited about it, we’re looking forward to it.
