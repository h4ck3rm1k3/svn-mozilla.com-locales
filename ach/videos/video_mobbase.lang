;Your apps on all your devices
apps mamegi ki kom jami tici


;MobBase builds apps for bands and labels.
MobBase gero apps pi bands ki lebel.


;We make it very easy for bands to connect with their fans all across mobile devices.
Wamiyo ne bedo yot pi bands wek kub kwede fan gi weng kun beo i jami tic me cing.


;We recognize that there is a big problem that artists had.
Waniang ada ni tye peko madwong ma lago cal obedo kwede.


;They have all these fans who are using all sorts of devices
Gin gutye ki fan magi weng bot jo ma tiyo ki jami tic mogo


;and their websites are not going to work well on various devices.
ci dyer bar me Web pe bitic kakare ikom jami tic mapol.


;So we started off working in native environments, iPhone first, then Android,
Dong wa cako tic woko i ka ma orumo wa, iPhone namba acel, eka Android,


;and each has its own complexities and subtleties that make it difficult to maintain and iterate on both.
ci acel acel tye ki jange mapol ci en mamwonya ma miyo gwoko ne tek odoco ki woto ikom gin weng.


;We quickly realized that the key to getting a cross-platform solution for most artists was HTML5
Wa niang woko oyot ni lagony me donyo i cobo platform pi lugo cal mapol obedo HTML5


;and the reason is this:
ci gin ma omiyo en aye eni ni:


;To build a native iPhone App, a native Android App and a native whatever App, is time consuming
Pi gero App iPhone marwate, App Android marwate ki App mo keken marwate, balo cawa


;and each app is a different project and each app requires different assets
ci app acel acel obedo purujek mapat pat ci mito jami mapat pat


;and it becomes a real headache in terms of time and also money.
ci bedo twon labar wic i cik me cawa ki cente bene.


;What HTML5 allows our clients to do is to build the app once and distribute it everywhere.
Ngom ma HTML5 weko jo wa timo obedo me gero app tek ka kipoko ne kan mo keken.


;With the  Mozilla Marketplace we have a unique opportunity to distribute web applications.
Kwede  Cuk me Mozilla watye ki tic maber pi poko purugram me web.


;This is something that was king of a conundrum for us, you know
Man obedo gin mo ma obedo laker me conundrum pir wa, in ingeo


;we want to be able to distribute these and not just provide links.
wamito bedo ki twero me poko magi ci pok ka kakube keken.


;When Mozilla reached out to us and we entered a partnership with them
Tek Mozilla oo bot wa kany ci wakube donyo kwedgi


;it was great because it was an App store.
Pire tek pien obedo citowa me App.


;Fans can go to it, they can see the assets, they can see the description
Fan romo wot ie, gin twero neno jami, gutwero neno lok ie


;they can download it just like theyâ€™re used to downloading an Android or iPhone app.
Gitwero gamo ne calo ka kit ma gitiyo kwede pi gamo Android onyo app me iPhone.


;So, Mozilla provides a great, great market and a great distribution channels for our HTML5 Apps.
Dong, MOzilla poko maber, cuk maber ki yoo poko maber odoco pi Apps me HTML5.


;distribute your apps
